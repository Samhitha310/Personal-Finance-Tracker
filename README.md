This JavaScript code manages a basic transaction tracking system for a web application. It includes functionalities to display transactions, update the balance, and add new transactions. The transactions are stored in an array, and their details are presented in a list on the webpage. The balance is dynamically calculated based on the transaction amounts. Users can input new transactions through a form, and the data is stored in the array. Additionally, the transactions are saved to local storage, allowing data persistence between page reloads. The code employs event listeners to handle form submissions and page unloading.
